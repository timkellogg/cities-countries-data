# Purpose

This repo is meant to be a useful start to building applications where geocoded data is necessary. It contains two spreadsheets - cities and countries. The cities data has been adapted from http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/ and the countries data is adapted from https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/blob/master/all/all.csv. This is meant to be a unified place.

# Use

The intended usage is to seed a database with geo data that you can then use however you wish. I gathered and parsed this data for my own development
